<h1 align="center">Rock, Paper, Scissors" Bot🤖</h1>

---
This is a simple bot for playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors." The game is most often played by two players. On the count of
three, players simultaneously make a hand shape out of three possible combinations: rock (fist), scissors (index and
middle fingers separated), or paper (palm). If the shapes are the same, it's a draw. Otherwise, paper wins (covers)
rock, rock wins (breaks) scissors, and scissors wins (cuts) paper.

The bot is multiplayer. It does not store any user state. When a user sends a message with their choice,
a random bot response is generated, and a message is sent to the chat with the result—who won. This is a very simple
bot, purely for demonstrating how to use regular
buttons.
